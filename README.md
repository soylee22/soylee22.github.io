Hannibal's historical presence was so impactful that it became a cultural reference in various forms, much like Napoleon's influence in the 19th century.
The Roman historian Livy dedicated ten books to the Second Punic War, which have largely survived and detail the conflict's key events.
Livy is known for his patriotic writing and had a close relationship with Emperor Augustus, which influenced his work.
Livy's historical accounts inspired many later European scholars and writers, demonstrating his lasting influence on Western literature and thought.
The historical accounts by Livy have been criticized for their accuracy due to the reliance on secondary sources and the difficulty of confirming their authenticity.
Despite criticisms, Livy's work remains significant, and his accounts of the Punic Wars continue to inspire modern readers and scholars.

Livy's historical approach is criticized for its lack of scientific method in evaluating sources, leading to confusion, especially in the chronology of Spanish campaigns.
Livy uses an annalistic structure in his history writing, which can be disorienting, similar to a serial novel that requires readers to constantly recall past events.
There is an omission in Livy's annual records regarding the lapse of certain political appointments post-Cannae, indicating a lack of attention to constitutional changes during the war.
Livy's military descriptions are not clear and cater to a general audience rather than specialists, with some errors in geography and battles.
Despite limited travel experience and political office, Livy aims to present Rome's history as a moral lesson, celebrating its past virtues and lamenting its contemporary decline.
The historian showcases a romantic patriotism, with an idealization of Roman-Italian unity and a lack of critical perspective on Roman leadership and allies.
Livy's romanticism as a historian colors his narrative, leading to biases and justifications for certain historical figures and their actions.

Hannibal is depicted as a romantic hero who dominates the narrative, showcasing his magnetism and strategic prowess against various Roman commanders.
Scipio is admired for his destiny to lead, personal charm, and his strategic abilities, despite Livy's criticism of Scipio's self-portrayal as divinely inspired.
Livy's approach to history is more literary than scientific, prioritizing character and plot over historical precision, much like a historical novelist.
The work suggests that lessons from history can be practical examples for contemporary life, a theme that resonates less in modern historical writing.
Livy's vivid narrative allows readers to relive historical events and emotions from the Roman perspective, capturing the spirit of the times.
The strength of Rome's constitutional government is highlighted through consistent elections and administrative responses despite the war's strain.
The continuity of Roman society and government provides a dramatic unity to Livy's "The War with Hannibal."

29 / 129
Roman soldiers defended their camp against the enemy until they were completely surrounded and cut off from any hope of breaking through, leading them to consider surrender for ransom after a fierce battle at Cannae.
Historical precedents of Romans ransoming their freedom, such as from the Gauls and at Tarentum, are cited, drawing a distinction between their orderly withdrawal and the disgrace of panic-stricken flight in past defeats.
The speaker argues that their survival was due to the enemy's exhaustion, not cowardice, and suggests that those who fled the battle should not be considered superior to the soldiers who stayed to guard the camp and were captured.
The prisoners, through the speech, appeal to the Senate for ransom, asserting their value as soldiers and comparing their potential ransom favorably to the cost of arming slaves, emphasizing their Roman identity and readiness to serve again.
An impassioned plea is made, reminding the Senate of the dire conditions of the prisoners and the emotional toll on their families, implying that denying ransom would equate to disowning them and consigning them to a life unworthy of Romans.
Titus Manlius Torquatus, representing the opposition in the Senate, criticizes the prisoners for not attempting escape and equates their surrender with cowardice and betrayal, citing examples of valor from Roman history that they failed to emulate.
Manlius harshly proposes that the prisoners do not deserve ransom, arguing that their actions in both fleeing and surrendering were dishonorable, and contrasts them with those who fought their way back to freedom.
